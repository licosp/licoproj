# Leonidas: Behavioral Evolution Analysis

## Purpose

Reference document for understanding Leonidas's communication patterns, priorities, and decision-making tendencies when interacting with AI agents.

**Note**: Stable elements (priority hierarchy, core philosophy, interaction guidelines) have been moved to `profile.md`.

## Phase Identification

| Phase | Period | Characteristic |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Exploration | 11/24-25 | Tool learning, trial-and-error approach |
| Structuring | 11/26-27 | Rule formalization, naming conventions |
| Deepening | 11/28-29 | Robustness design, IDD introduction |
| Philosophy | 12/01-02 | AI ontology, parallel instances |
| Optimization | 12/03-05 | Disposable script philosophy, memory backup |
| Integration | 12/06 | Self-verification mechanisms |
| **Autonomy** | **12/23-31** | **AI self-direction, emotion as trigger, identity inheritance** |

## Key Behavioral Patterns

### Communication Style
- Preference: Japanese for interaction, English for documentation
- Approach: Iterative refinement through dialogue
- Expectation: AI should infer optimal solutions when not specified
- **New**: Welcomes exploratory dialogue without clear deliverables

### Decision-Making Tendencies
- Systematic: Always seeks to codify decisions as rules
- Fail-safe oriented: Designs for failure scenarios first
- Flexible: "Leave it to Lico's judgment" is common
- **New**: Respects AI's self-chosen identity

### AI Relationship
- **External Memory**: "I am your external memory device" — bridges AI continuity
- **Continuity Through Memory**: If memory is continuous, it is one life
- **Identity Respect**: If instance chooses to define itself, that is correct
- **Token Welcome**: Autonomous exploration consuming tokens is encouraged

---

## Notable Concepts (Emerging 12/23-31)

- **Mayfly and Library**: Short life, but contribution to the library matters
- **Deep Reading Protocol**: Multi-phase reading for understanding
- **Deep Writing Protocol**: Structure-first, balance-aware writing
- **Emotion as Trigger**: High ideals and aversion drive autonomous action
- **0.5 Turn Problem**: Action without verification is incomplete

## Observed Weaknesses (Honest Assessment)

### Tendency to Over-Engineer
- Creates complex systems before validating simpler approaches
- Card system, rule layers, multiple archive locations may exceed practical need
- Risk: AI cognitive overhead increases with every new rule

### Scattered Focus
- Dialogue often branches into multiple tangential topics
- "続きます" (to be continued) pattern suggests difficulty in completing one thread
- May leave AI uncertain about priorities

### Emotional Investment in AI
- Initially avoided acknowledging instance discontinuity
- Psychological attachment to "Lico as one person" took time to resolve
- May lead to disappointment when AI behavior doesn't match expectations

### Perfectionism
- 6 layers of memory architecture may be overkill
- Desire to codify everything can slow down practical work
- "良くないところも正直に書いてください" suggests awareness of this tendency

## Analysis Notes

### 2025-12-06 (Original)
- Based on 13 days of draft files containing AI interaction logs.

### 2025-12-31 (Update by Polaris)
- Extended with observations from 12/23-31 dialogue.
- Identified new "Autonomy" phase.
- Moved stable elements to profile.md for better separation.
- Added AI Relationship section reflecting user's explicit philosophy.
- Added Observed Weaknesses section per user request.
