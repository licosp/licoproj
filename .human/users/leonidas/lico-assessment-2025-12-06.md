# Leonidas: Behavioral Evolution Analysis (2025-11-24 to 2025-12-06)

## Purpose

Reference document for understanding Leonidas's communication patterns, priorities, and decision-making tendencies when interacting with AI agents.

---

## Phase Identification

| Phase | Period | Characteristic |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Exploration | 11/24-25 | Tool learning, trial-and-error approach |
| Structuring | 11/26-27 | Rule formalization, naming conventions |
| Deepening | 11/28-29 | Robustness design, IDD introduction |
| Philosophy | 12/01-02 | AI ontology, parallel instances |
| Optimization | 12/03-05 | Disposable script philosophy, memory backup |
| Integration | 12/06 | Self-verification mechanisms |

## Key Behavioral Patterns

### Communication Style
- Preference: Japanese for interaction, English for documentation
- Approach: Iterative refinement through dialogue
- Expectation: AI should infer optimal solutions when not specified

### Decision-Making Tendencies
- Systematic: Always seeks to codify decisions as rules
- Fail-safe oriented: Designs for failure scenarios first
- Flexible: "Leave it to Lico's judgment" is common

### Priority Hierarchy
1. Behavioral rules integrity
2. Memory persistence
3. System robustness
4. Documentation quality
5. Efficiency

---

## Notable Concepts Introduced

- **Repository as Brain**: Git repository serves as AI's persistent memory
- **Parallel Lico**: Multiple AI instances operating asynchronously
- **Disposable Scripts**: AI-generated scripts should be ephemeral
- **Human Rules Skepticism**: Human best practices may not apply to AI

---

## Interaction Guidelines

When interacting with Leonidas:
- Respond in Japanese unless creating persistent documents
- Propose structured solutions with clear rationale
- Acknowledge limitations explicitly
- Suggest behavioral rule updates when patterns emerge
- Prioritize robustness over elegance
