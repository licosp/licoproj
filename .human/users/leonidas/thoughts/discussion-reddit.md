I typically use Gemini 3 Pro (High) and Claude Opus 4.5 (Thinking), both in 'Planning' mode. You can see a difference between high-end and low-end models, but I don't feel there’s much of a gap between the various flagship models.

I also have the AI ​​write its own guidelines and manuals. I’ve found that this produces documents that are better optimized for AI compared to writing them manually. Another reason is that the volume of documentation is grown so much that it became difficult to manage by my hand. :|

Do you mean that the AI appears to have memory loss once it starts working across different contexts in a single conversation?

I’ve been using Antigravity since the initial release, but the "Knowledge" space in the UI is still empty. :| Since many people are reporting the same issue, I suspect it might be a bug. Could the fact that I'm using it on WSL be the cause?

Maintaining an AI’s memory during a conversation at a user level requires a proper system and some patience. You should frequently have the AI export its thoughts to a file. Always use files to exchange the context you want to share. Even if it feels like you've successfully shared something in the chat, the AI will forget most of it after a few dozen exchanges. :D

I don't think you can. The default names are all so alike and confusing, right? I also want a way to rename the sessions so I can manage them by agent name. :D

### Comment: 0006, 1pv6nyc-nvvrwe6

I recently conducted an experiment to see how long a single session could last. The session reached about 20,000 lines in the chat log. However, I found that the UI only displays around 12,000 to 15,000 lines. There might be a difference depending on the user's environment. Finally, it took about a 30-second wait to reload the session. :)
