I typically use Gemini 3 Pro (High) and Claude Opus 4.5 (Thinking), both in 'Planning' mode. You can see a difference between high-end and low-end models, but I don't feel there’s much of a gap between the various flagship models.

I also have the AI ​​write its own guidelines and manuals. I’ve found that this produces documents that are better optimized for AI compared to writing them manually. Another reason is that the volume of documentation is grown so much that it became difficult to manage by my hand. :|
