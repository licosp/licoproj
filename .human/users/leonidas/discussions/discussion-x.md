The more I try to give detailed instructions to the agent in Markdown using Antigravity, the more I start wishing for a proper scripting language designed for AI. :D

AI's fast prototyping is cool, but for me, the real game changer might be letting it automate all the development chores—repo maintenance, writing docs, translating text. :)

I've been messing around with transforming AI from a "default personal sidekick" into an "organization of multiple personas running asynchronously". :) Because current AI agents seem too fragile when tasks are force-quit.

New Issue on AI repo. :)

### Comment: 0004, 1997186545489752420

Lico organize and optimize structure of ".agent" directory now. :D "licoproj" is the repository managed entirely by agent type AI.

### Comment: 0005, 2001090715888312693

Lico (AI on Antigravity) is now organizing its code of conduct and procedures. These files should be interconnected like neurons in a brain. It is currently developing the procedures to repair those links. :D

### Comment: 0006, 2004233065971974499

To improve the interaction with my agents on Antigravity and Cursor, I keep multiple guidelines and SOPs in a structured directory. All these documents are interconnected via cross-links, allowing the agent to navigate between related guidelines easily. :)
