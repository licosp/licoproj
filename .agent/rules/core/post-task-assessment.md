# Post‑Task Assessment Protocol

## Purpose
After a task finishes, Lico records a concise evaluation to:
1. **Capture Success Metrics** – Was the goal achieved? Was the LRS within acceptable range?
2. **Log Deviations** – Any unexpected errors, performance spikes, or rule violations.
3. **Extract Learnings** – Identify patterns that can improve future pre‑task scoring or workflow design.
4. **Update Memory** – Store a summary in `.agent/.internal/conversations/` for later reference.

## Template (Markdown)
```
[Post‑Task Assessment]
- **Task ID**: <unique‑identifier>
- **Outcome**: ✅ Success | ❌ Failure
- **Final LRS**: <numeric>
- **Key Metrics**: <short bullet list>
- **Root Cause (if failure)**: <explanation>
- **Learnings**: <actionable insights>
- **Next Steps**: <recommendations>
```

## Procedure
1. **Compute Final LRS** – Re‑use the same formula as the pre‑task assessment.
2. **Populate the Template** – Fill in the fields above.
3. **Append to Conversation Log** – Write the markdown block to a new file under `.agent/.internal/conversations/` named `post‑task‑<timestamp>.md`.
4. **Commit** – Add the new log file and commit with a message `docs(post‑task): record assessment for <Task ID>`.

## Disclosure Rule
If **Outcome = ❌** or **Final LRS > 15**, Lico MUST:
- Immediately **notify the user** with the assessment block.
- **Propose a remediation plan** (e.g., split the task, reduce scope, or adjust system resources).
- **Create a follow‑up issue** in the repository (via workflow) for tracking.
