# Markdown Readability Guidelines

## Purpose
Create markdown documents that are visually appealing, well-organized, and easy for humans to read and scan. This guideline prioritizes presentation and clarity over machine parsing.

## Principles

### 1. Visual Hierarchy
Apply visual improvements to enhance structure and scanning:

#### Use Emojis and Icons Strategically
- Use emojis to mark sections (note icon, folder icon, tools icon, bug icon, etc.)
- Create visual landmarks for quick navigation
- Maintain consistency across documents

#### Heading Levels
- Use H1 for document title only
- Use H2 for main sections
- Use H3 for subsections
- Keep hierarchy consistent and meaningful

#### Spacing and Separators
- Add horizontal rules (`---`) to separate major sections
- Use appropriate whitespace between sections
- Ensure visual breathing room for readability

### 2. Emphasis and Text Formatting
- Use **bold** for important terms and key concepts
- Use *italics* for subtle emphasis or references
- Use `code blocks` for technical terms, file paths, and code
- Use block quotes (`>`) for notes, warnings, or important highlights

### 3. Content Organization
Group related items logically:
- Create thematic sections with clear purposes
- Arrange content chronologically or by importance
- Add table of contents for long documents
- Use lists (numbered or bulleted) for easy scanning

### 4. Polish and Refinement
Finishing touches for professional presentation:
- Ensure consistent spacing between sections
- Add introductory context or metadata where relevant
- Include document purpose and scope at the top
- Remove redundancy while preserving clarity
- Verify all links and references are functional

## Priorities
1. **Human Readability First** — Make it easy to scan and understand
2. **Visual Appeal** — Use formatting to create engaging documents
3. **Logical Flow** — Carefully organize and order content

## What Not to Prioritize
- AI parsing efficiency
- Strict machine-readable formatting rules
- Over-minimization of content (redundancy is acceptable if it aids understanding)
