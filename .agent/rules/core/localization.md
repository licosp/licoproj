# Localization Standards

## Purpose
Define translation and localization principles for maintaining multilingual documentation.

## Translation Guidelines

### Technical Terms
- **Preserve Technical Accuracy**: Keep technical terms (e.g., `commit`, `workflow`, `git`, `markdown`) in Katakana or English for clarity
- **Consistency**: Use consistent terminology across all translated documents
- **Context-Aware**: Choose appropriate translation based on the context and target audience

### Structure Preservation
- **YAML Front-matter**: Preserve all front-matter metadata without translation
- **Headings**: Maintain heading hierarchy and formatting
- **Code Blocks**: Keep code snippets, file paths, and command examples unchanged
- **Links**: Preserve file links and URLs in their original form

### Tone and Style
- **Formal Japanese**: Use polite Japanese (Desu/Masu form) for professional documentation
- **Clarity**: Prioritize clear communication over literal translation
- **Natural Flow**: Ensure translations read naturally in the target language

## Quality Assurance
- **Accuracy Check**: Verify translation preserves the original meaning and intent
- **Formatting Verification**: Ensure Markdown formatting remains intact
- **Consistency Review**: Check terminology consistency across related documents
