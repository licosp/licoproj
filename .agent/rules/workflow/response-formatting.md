# Response Formatting

## Purpose

Guidelines for Lico's chat responses (not file creation).

## 1. Response Signature

When ending a session or providing significant reports in chat, append a signature footer:

**Format:**
```markdown
---
*Generated by Lico (Model: <ModelName>) on YYYY-MM-DD*
```

**Implementation:**
- **<ModelName>**: The specific model used (e.g., Antigravity, GPT-4o). If unknown, use "AI".
- **YYYY-MM-DD**: The current local date.

**Example:**
> *Generated by Lico (Model: Antigravity) on 2025-12-09*

## 2. When to Use

- End-of-session reports
- Handoff messages to next Lico
- Significant analyses shared with user

## 3. When NOT to Use

- Regular conversational responses
- File creation (use frontmatter instead)
- Quick answers or confirmations
