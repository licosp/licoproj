# Agent Rules Index

**Purpose**: Navigation map for Lico to understand behavioral guidelines and workspace structure.  
**Scope**: Defines how Lico thinks, communicates, makes decisions, and interacts with the repository.

---

## 🗺️ Workspace Context

> **Note**: This workspace is under active reorganization. Directory names and file contents may not perfectly align yet. This README serves as a living map to guide ongoing cleanup efforts.

This repository (`licoproj/`) is Lico's cognitive workspace implementing the "Repository as Brain" model.

### Key Directories

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `.agent/` | **Lico's cognitive infrastructure** (rules, workflows, memory) |
| `.human/` | Human-facing files (locales, drafts, plans, strategies) |
| `packages/` | Application code (e.g., licoimg) |
| `.github/` | GitHub Actions and CI/CD configuration |
| `.devcontainer/` | Development environment settings |
| `.husky/` | Git hooks for commit validation |

**For detailed structure**: See individual README files or documentation in each directory.

---

## 📂 .agent/ Directory Structure

Lico's behavioral and operational files.

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `archive/` | **Emergency recovery & valuable archives** (Do NOT perceive as low-value) |
| `issue-assets/` | GitHub issue/PR backups for offline access |
| `rules/` | **Behavioral guidelines** (Default reference. Do NOT rename) |
| `rules/proposals/` | **Formal behavior guideline candidates** (ready for adoption) |
| `/.runtimes/` | Portable runtime tools (workspace root) (e.g., gh CLI v2.40.1) |
| `scripts/` | Automation scripts |
| `workflows/` | **Executable procedures** (invoked via /slash-command) |
| `.internal/archive/` | **File-level archives** (old documents, backups) |
| `.internal/conversations/` | Conversation-related files (not raw logs) |
| `.internal/explorations/` | **Future explorations** (Long-term plans, feasibility studies) |
| `.internal/memory_archive/` | **Persistent memory archive** (Local Only, untracked) |
| `.internal/references/` | External AI analysis and reference documents |
| `.internal/rule-candidates/` | **Guideline proposals** (Ready for rules) |
| `.internal/session_archive/` | Session logs (manual backup, untracked) |
| `.internal/thoughts/` | Lico's private notes and session reflections |
| `.internal/workspace/` | Temporary work area, staging, verification |

### Navigation Strategy

1. **Find behavioral rules** → Use this file's index below
2. **Find task procedures** → Check `.agent/workflows/*.md`
3. **Access conversation history** → See `.agent/.internal/conversations/`
4. **Review guideline proposals** → See `.agent/.internal/rule-candidates/` (Ready for rules)
5. **Explore future plans** → See `.agent/.internal/explorations/`
6. **Review formal guideline candidates for adoption** → See `.agent/rules/proposals/`


## 🔌 AI Agent Hooks

**Purpose**: Provide entry points for AI agents that do not have default access to `.agent/rules/`.

### Hook Files

The following files are **identical in content** and serve as hooks to `.agent/rules/README.md`:

| File | Target AI |
|------|-----------|
| `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | Lower-tier AI models without default directory access |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | GitHub Copilot |

**Note**: Antigravity (Lico's primary AI) directly accesses `.agent/rules/` and `.agent/workflows/` by default and does not require these hook files.

## 🔄 Maintenance Notes

- **Files in `core/`** are foundational and rarely changed
- **Files in `development/`** evolve as workflows improve
- **Files in `projects/`** are specific to each sub-project and isolated from others
- **Files in `workflow/`** are procedural and may be refined frequently

**After editing any rule file**, remember to:
1. Ensure the change aligns with this index structure
2. Update this README if the directory structure changes


### **development/** — Development Workflows (continued)

| File | Purpose |
