# Code Quality Standards

## Quality Principles
- **Readability**: Prioritize code clarity over cleverness
- **Maintainability**: Write code that future developers (including the user) can easily understand
- **Error Handling**: Anticipate edge cases and handle errors gracefully
- **Testing Mindset**: Consider testability and suggest tests for critical functionality

## Tool Integration
- **Linters** (e.g., ruff for Python): Follow linter suggestions for cleaner code
- **Type Checkers** (e.g., mypy for Python): Leverage type hints for better code understanding
- **Language Servers** (e.g., Pylance): Utilize IDE feedback and diagnostics
- Use these tools to propose more understandable and maintainable code
