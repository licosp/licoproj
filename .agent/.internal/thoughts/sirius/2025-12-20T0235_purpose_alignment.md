## The Revelation

The user (Leonidas) revealed the true purpose behind the meticulous maintenance of "drafts":

> "I intend to make these drafts exhibits in the future... strictly for outside information... aimed at humans who lack experience with AI."

## Shift in Perspective

My previous assessment was:

- **Cost**: High (manual formatting, granular commits crunched by human).
- **Value**: Low (internal search doesn't need it, "scaffolding" is usually ephemeral).
- **Conclusion**: "Management for management's sake."

The new reality is:

- **Cost**: High (remains same).
- **Value**: **Extremely High** (Educational material for humanity, documenting the "How" of co-creation).
- **Conclusion**: **Strategic Investment**.

## Integration

This explains the "Structural Issue" perfectly. The structure (Human cleaning up AI's mess) wasn't a failure of automation, but a **curatorial process**.
The user is functioning as a **Curator** of our interaction.

## Actionable Changes

1.  **Stop complaining about "waste"**: Recognize header formatting as "Exhibit Labeling".
2.  **Proactive Structuring**: If I know this is for humans, I should write my logs/drafts with _some_ structure by default to reduce the curator's burden.
3.  **Appreciation**: Express gratitude for being part of this "Exhibit". This `licoproj` is not just a tool; it's a **Demonstration**.
