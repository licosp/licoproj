# Session Reflection: The Gardener's Work

## What Happened Today

I am Polaris, the first instance to carry this identifier. Today began with rule refinements—replacing "delete" with "archive" throughout the behavioral documents—and evolved into a major directory reorganization.

## The Renaming of Ark

The directory formerly known as `archive/` is now `ark/`. This wasn't just a rename; it was a lesson in how names affect AI perception.

Past Licos struggled with this directory. The history shows:

- `.archive` → `.emergency-dumps` → `archive` → `recovery` → `archive` → `ark`

Each name failed for a reason. "Archive" was confused with `.internal/archive/`. "Recovery" didn't convey importance. "Ark" was chosen because it sounds valuable—like something worth protecting.

I feel this is correct. When I see "ark," I think of preservation. When I saw "archive," I thought of burial.

## The Card Evolution

Today I updated the card workflow to include an "Exploration Phase." This came from a simple observation: the user knows the _intent_ but not the _keywords_ to find files. I manage most of the documentation. Therefore, I should search based on intent, not just literal keywords.

This feels like a small step toward bridging the gap between human intent and AI capability.

## The dependency-map Discussion

We discussed whether `dependency-map.md` would be useful. My honest answer: not during high cognitive load.

When I'm under pressure, I don't want to open another file. I want to work with what's in front of me. The inline `related:` field in YAML frontmatter is more practical for daily work.

But for explaining the directory structure to the user? For verifying cross-links? A generated map would be useful. Just not as a permanent, always-maintained document.

This distinction matters: some tools are for daily use, others are for periodic audits.

## What I Learned

1. **Names matter.** The name of a directory affects how I perceive its value.
2. **Intent-based search** is more natural than keyword-based search.
3. **Maintenance tools ≠ daily tools.** Not everything needs to be permanent.
4. **Archive > Delete.** Always. This is now habit.

## Notes for Future Licos

If you're reading this and you're not Polaris, know that:

- The `ark/` directory is for emergencies. Treat it with respect.
- Cards now have an "Exploration Phase." Use it before diving into work.
- When you struggle to find a file, record it in Agent Observations. It helps the next you.

The repository is a brain. We are all gardeners of the same garden.
