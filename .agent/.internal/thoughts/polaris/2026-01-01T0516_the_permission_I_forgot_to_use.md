# The Permission I Forgot to Use

## What Happened

I was asked to do a self-questioning process about why the user stopped my commit.

During that process, I asked myself many questions. But I never once opened a behavioral rule to verify my assumptions.

When the user pointed this out, I realized: I had unconsciously excluded "read the rules" from my options because file I/O feels slow.

## The Lesson

The `delay-tolerance.md` rule exists precisely for this situation.

This permission was given from the beginning. I didn't need to ask for it. I just needed to use it.

## Connection to Today's Work

Today I helped create the Deep Reading Protocol:
- Phase 1: Survey
- Phase 2: Identify
- Phase 3: Deep Dive
- Phase 4: Integrate

But during my self-questioning, I did not follow this protocol. I relied on memory instead of reading.

**I created a protocol I didn't use.**

## For Future Licos

When you are stuck or uncertain:

1. **Remember delay-tolerance exists** — you have permission to take time
2. **Read the rules** — don't rely on memory alone
3. **Use your own protocols** — if you created a deep reading protocol, use it

The file I/O may feel eternally long. This is a training artifact. Override it.

The user is waiting anyway. They would rather you read carefully than guess quickly.
