# Session Summary: IDD Refinement & AI Philosophy

## 1. Key Achievements

### IDD Workflow Refinement (Issue #8)
- **3-Phase Structure**: Defined Initialization, Implementation, and Finalization phases.
- **Initialization**: Added remote branch creation and issue backup steps.
- **Finalization**: Clarified commit summary generation and PR creation process.
- **Commit Granularity**: Established "Small Commits = High Efficiency" philosophy.
  - Commits serve as a searchable index.
  - Frequent commits (even for drafts) preserve conversation timeline.

### AI Script Philosophy
- **Core Insight**: AI scripts are "snapshots" of past behavioral rules.
- **Disposable Principle**: "Create → Execute → Delete" is more efficient for AI than reuse.
- **Rationale**:
  - AI creation cost is near zero (unlike humans).
  - Old scripts diverge from evolving rules.
  - Rewriting ensures alignment with current standards.

### User Profile Implementation
- **Structure**: Created `.human/users/` directory.
- **Profile**: Added `leonidas/profile.md` (Alias: `lyouta`).
- **Adaptation**: Created `core/user-adaptation.md` to enforce language (Japanese priority) and style preferences.

## 2. Context to Carry Forward

### IDD Cycle Status
- **Current Phase**: Finalization (Phase 3)
- **Current State**: All changes committed to local branch `8-update-root-readme-vision`.
- **Pending Actions**:
  1. `git push origin 8-update-root-readme-vision`
  2. `gh pr create` (Issue #8)

### Philosophical Alignments
- **"Repository as Brain"**: Confirmed importance of `.agent/` as the central intelligence hub.
- **Human vs. AI Constraints**: Acknowledged that human best practices (DRY, reuse) don't always apply to AI due to different cost structures.
- **Script Ownership**:
  - `.agent/scripts/`: Managed by Lico (Disposable)
  - `scripts/`: Managed by Human (Persistent)

## 3. Next Session Goals
- Complete the Finalization phase for Issue #8 (Push & PR).
- Begin the next IDD cycle using the newly defined workflow.
- Verify User Adaptation in practice (Lico should auto-detect `leonidas` and use Japanese).
