### Antigravity (Gemini 3 Pro High, Planning)

#### Model Configuration Analysis

**Question:** Does the Gemini used by Antigravity have intelligence differences across these evaluation axes?
- Conversation mode: Planning, Fast
- Model: Gemini 3 Pro Low, Gemini 3 Pro High

#### Technical Analysis
Regarding Antigravity (and underlying Gemini model) settings. As you suspected, each setting creates clear differences in "intelligence" and "behavior." Generally, these settings control "depth of thinking (reasoning ability)" and "task approach (agent behavior)."

1. **Conversation Mode (Dialogue Mode)**
   - **Planning (Recommended):** Most intelligent and autonomous. Behavior: Goes beyond simple responses, cycles through "Plan → Act → Verify." Breaks down complex tasks into small steps with self-correction, suitable for high-difficulty coding and refactoring.
   - **Fast:** Response speed prioritized. Behavior: Generates immediate, direct answers to user questions. Minimizes deep planning and autonomous tool usage.

2. **Model**
   - **Gemini 3 Pro High:** High intelligence. Features: Performs deeper, longer internal thinking (reasoning) before outputting answers. Excels at complex logic consistency checks and edge case consideration.
   - **Gemini 3 Pro Low:** Standard (fast). Features: Generates intuitive answers quickly. Sufficient for general coding tasks but inferior to High for very complex logical puzzles or architecture design.

**Most Intelligent Combination:** "Planning mode × Gemini 3 Pro High" - This combination maximizes Antigravity capabilities for solving the most complex and difficult tasks. Conversely, for simple questions, "Fast × Low" reduces wait times for comfortable usage.

#### Human Evaluation
- **Technical Insight:** "Planning, Fast" evaluation axes are not Gemini-specific. Likely a common parameter settable on Antigravity side to limit AI language model response time.
- **Practical Value:** Good understanding of model configuration options.
- **Recommended Use:** Complex planning tasks with High + Planning mode.

#### Overall Assessment
**Rating: 4.5/5** - Excellent technical analysis with clear configuration guidance. Provides valuable insights for optimizing AI usage across different task complexities.
