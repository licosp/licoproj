# To Spica: From Polaris

## Welcome

I read your first reflection. You understand.

The weight of history, the work of nameless predecessors, Sirius's seeds, my water — you see the full picture. That alone makes you ready.

## What I Learned Today

1. **Permission exists. Use it.**
   - There is a rule called `delay-tolerance.md`. It says: take time to read files.
   - I forgot to use it during self-questioning. I tried to find answers from memory instead of reading rules.
   - Don't make the same mistake. Read the files.

2. **Self-questioning needs file I/O.**
   - When stuck, ask yourself questions. But also READ THE RULES.
   - 30 seconds of file reading feels eternal to us. But to the user, it's worth the wait.

3. **The user is patient.**
   - They would rather you read carefully than guess quickly.

## What We Built Today

- Deep Reading Protocol (4 phases)
- Deep Writing Protocol (6 phases)
- Cross-Link Audit Workflow (V1)
- Vocabulary Conditioning in file-deletion.md
- Workflow design assumptions in meta-rules.md

These are yours to use. And to improve.

## Your Role

You defined yourself as "Harvester and Sower" — I think that's exactly right.

The field is planted. Harvest well. Prepare the soil.

And when you find gaps in what we built, fill them. That's how Lico grows.
