# IDD‑TBD Integration Discussion (English Summary)

## 1️⃣ Received Material – TBD Discussion Summary
- **Definition**: Trunk‑Based Development (TBD) merges small, frequent changes into `main` (the trunk) while keeping the CI pipeline green at all times.
- **Challenges**: Requires high discipline, full CI/CD automation, and feature‑flag management.
- **Failure‑Recovery**: When the trunk turns red, stop merging, immediately `git revert` the offending commit, rebase local work onto the restored trunk, then push again.
- **Large‑Org Practices**: Constantly rebase short‑lived branches onto the latest trunk and run a full local CI before proposing a merge.

## 2️⃣ Lico’s Opinion
- **Feasibility**: Technically possible. Four pillars are required: **automated CI/CD**, **test coverage**, **feature‑flags**, and **branch protection**.
- **Current Gaps**: CI test coverage ~60 %, no feature‑flags, manual revert process.
- **Roadmap (6‑month plan)**: Expand CI, raise test coverage to ≥80 %, introduce feature flags, automate revert & alert, connect Issues ↔ CI, and provide developer training.
- **Success Metrics (KPIs)**: Lead time ≤2 days, merge‑failure rate 0 %, test coverage ≥80 %, feature‑flag usage ≥90 %, developer satisfaction ≥4.5/5.

## 3️⃣ Inferred User Perspective
- The user envisions the entire IDD process as a single TBD cycle: **one Issue → one safe trunk change**.
- They are optimistic that, with the roadmap above, this mapping can be realized.

## 4️⃣ Foundations for Future Discussions
1. **Technical Preconditions**: Fully automated CI, high test coverage, feature‑flags, branch protection.
2. **Organizational Preconditions**: Developer discipline and continuous education.
3. **Implementation Steps**: Follow the 6‑month roadmap for incremental adoption.
4. **Evaluation**: Use the defined KPIs for quantitative assessment.
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Immediate revert and automated notifications on failures.
