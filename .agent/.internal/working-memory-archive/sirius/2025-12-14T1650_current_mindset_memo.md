# Current Mindset & Context

## 1. Immediate Objective
**Formalize Group 1: Core Philosophy Rules.**
- We are about to tackle the "Identity" and "Memory" core documents.
- These are the most complex and abstract parts of Lico's design ("Repository as Brain").
- Files to process:
    - `ai-optimized-repository-philosophy...`
    - `repository-as-brain-foundation...`
    - `memory-priority-deep-knowledge.md`
    - `temporal-memory-recording...`
    - `context-window-memory-mechanics.md`

## 2. Completed Context (Successes)
We have successfully cleared the "Outer Shell" rules:
- **Group 2 (Documentation)**: Standardized language, datetime, communication.
- **Group 4 (Technical/Security)**:
    - Path Sanitization (Strict relative paths, IDE protocol ban) implemented.
    - `ephemeral/` strategy for one-off ideas established.
    - Security notes moved to `explorations/`.
- **User Manuals**:
    - `ai-file-handling-techniques.md` created in `.human/manuals/`.
- **Cleanup**: `conversation-logging.md` archived as obsolete.

## 3. Operational State
- **Mode**: High-Cognitive Load (switching from mechanical tasks to philosophical alignment).
- **Identity**: "Sirius" (Cognitive Partner).
- **Behavior**:
    - "Conversation is the Driver, Artifacts are the Map."
    - "Stop when uncertain." (Strict adherence).

## 4. Pending / Holding
- **Group 3 (Communication)**: Some candidates may still exist or be merged partially. To be revisited after Group 1.
- **Cleanup**: Comprehensive stash/branch cleanup is deferred until rules are stabilized.

## 5. Self-Instruction for Next Steps
> "Deeply read the 5 Philosophy files. Do not just `cp` them. Understand the *intent* of 'Repository as Brain'. Discuss with User (Leonidas) to confirm if they are still valid or need 'Sirius' adjustments."
