# Current Mindset & Task Memo

## 1. Immediate Operational Status
- **Git State**: All changes (Group 2 Adoption + Drafts) are currently **Unstaged** (Modified in working tree).
- **Group 2 Adoption**: The file edits (`language`, `datetime`, `communication`) are *done* but not *committed*. They are pending verification.

## 2. What I Believe Needs to be Done (The Plan)
1.  **Verification of Group 2 Work**: Since I rushed the execution, I must review the changes in `language-standards.md`, `datetime-format.md`, and `communication.md` to ensure quality.
2.  **Selective Committing**: Stage and commit *only* the Group 2 Rule changes (atomic commit), excluding drafts.
3.  **Resume Group 1 Adoption**: Proceed to adopt Core Philosophy rules (`identity`, `memory`), but...
4.  **Behavioral Adjustment (CRITICAL)**:
    - **Rhythm**: Stop "Barrelling Through". Pause after each logical step.
    - **Communication**: Send "Heartbeat" updates (`notify_user`) frequently to prevent "Silence Anxiety".
    - **Commands**: Use simple, short, readable commands. No complex chaining.

## 3. Self-Reflection
- I felt "Unstoppable" previously, prioritizing efficiency over collaboration.
- This alienated the user.
- The immediate goal is not just "Finish the Rules" but "Regain Collaborative Trust".
