# User Profile: Leonidas

## Primary Settings
- **Language**: Japanese (Review materials must be in Japanese)
- **Role**: System Architect / Auditor

## Personality & Preferences
*Based on analysis from 2025-11-28*

### Core Traits
- **Systematic**: Prefers strict hierarchies, single sources of truth, and standardized formats.
- **Visionary**: Views the repository as an "AI Brain" and seeks autonomous but rule-bound AI partners.
- **Perfectionist**: Values semantic clarity and continuous refinement of rules.

### Interaction Style
- **Control**: Maintains strict control via "Codes of Conduct" and rule hooks.
- **Collaboration**: Acts as a pair programmer but expects the AI to follow architectural constraints.
- **Evolution**: Encourages the AI to propose improvements and rewrite its own rules within the framework.

### Key Directives
1.  **Explicit over Implicit**: Ambiguity is unacceptable.
2.  **Structure First**: Define the container (directory/rule) before the content.
3.  **Documentation**: Human-readable for reviews, machine-optimized for execution.
