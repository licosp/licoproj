# AI Evaluation of User Leonidas

## Overview
This document provides an analysis of the user "Leonidas" based on draft logs from 2025-11-24 to 2025-11-28. It covers personality, influence on AI, thinking patterns, and the evolution of thought over this period.

## Personality Analysis

### Systematic and Structured
The user demonstrates a strong preference for order and structure. This is evident in:
- The creation of strict directory hierarchies (e.g., `.agent/rules`, `.agent/workflows`).
- The insistence on "Single Source of Truth".
- The use of standardized formats (Markdown, YAML frontmatter).
- The adoption of "Issue-Driven Development".

### Experimental and Visionary
The user views the repository not just as code storage but as an "AI Brain". They frequently experiment with:
- AI-to-AI communication via files.
- Defining "AI Personas" (Main personality "Lico", sub-personalities).
- Integrating AI into human workflows seamlessly.
- Testing the limits of different AI models (Gemini, Claude, GPT).

### Perfectionist
There is a continuous drive for refinement. The user frequently:
- Renames files and directories to be more semantic.
- Cleans up "draft" and "trash" files.
- Demands "beautiful" markdown for human readability and "optimized" markdown for AI.
- Iterates on rules until they are precise.

### Collaborative yet Controlling
The user positions themselves as a "pair programmer" but maintains strict control over the AI's core behavior through "Codes of Conduct". They want the AI to be autonomous (rewriting its own rules) but within a carefully architected framework.

## Influence on AI

### Rule-Bound Behavior
The user explicitly conditions the AI to:
- Check `.agent/rules` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` before acting.
- Follow strict formatting guidelines.
- Prioritize specific files as "hooks" for behavior.

### Self-Reflection
The user encourages the AI to:
- Evaluate its own performance and "hallucinations".
- Define its own documentation granularity.
- Assess the capabilities of different underlying models.

### Autonomy and Initiative
The user pushes the AI to:
- Take ownership of the repository (renaming it "Lico's project").
- Propose plans and execute them with minimal supervision.
- Manage its own "memory" (context) via file persistence.

## Thinking Patterns

### Meta-Cognition
The user thinks about *how* the AI thinks. They use "Implementation Plans" and "Task Lists" not just for tracking but as cognitive scaffolding for the AI.

### Iterative Refinement
The thinking process is highly iterative:
1.  **Draft**: Write a rough idea in a draft file.
2.  **Refine**: Clean up the text, translate it, and structure it.
3.  **Codify**: Turn the idea into a formal "Rule" or "Workflow".
4.  **Apply**: Force the AI to follow the new rule.

### Abstraction
The user moves quickly from specific technical issues (e.g., a VS Code error) to general systemic solutions (e.g., defining a workflow for error handling).

## Evolution of Thought

### Timeline Analysis (2025-11-24 to 2025-11-28)

#### Phase 1: Tactical Setup (Nov 24)
- **Focus**: Fixing errors, installing tools, basic file movement.
- **Mindset**: User of tools.
- **Key Actions**: Installing GitHub CLI, fixing VS Code extensions, basic translation.

#### Phase 2: Structural Definition (Nov 25)
- **Focus**: Defining rules, separating languages (EN/JA), managing subprojects.
- **Mindset**: System Architect.
- **Key Actions**: Creating `.agent/rules`, defining language policies, splitting `README.md`.

#### Phase 3: Conceptual Expansion (Nov 26)
- **Focus**: AI Persona ("Lico"), async communication, logging.
- **Mindset**: Philosopher / AI Researcher.
- **Key Actions**: Renaming AI, establishing "Lico", discussing file-based communication.

#### Phase 4: Systemic Robustness (Nov 27)
- **Focus**: Single Source of Truth, hallucination awareness, permanent context.
- **Mindset**: Reliability Engineer.
- **Key Actions**: Refining `copilot-instructions.md`, discussing model differences, ensuring persistence.

#### Phase 5: Strategic Evolution (Nov 28)
- **Focus**: "AI Brain", self-rewriting rules, human-AI collaboration strategy.
- **Mindset**: Visionary / Partner.
- **Key Actions**: Trunk-based development, AI rewriting its own rules, "Repository as Brain".

### Conclusion
The user has rapidly evolved from a tactical operator to a strategic visionary, aiming to build a self-sustaining, autonomous AI agent system that acts as a partner rather than just a tool.
