# AI Conversation Techniques & Lico’s Analysis

## 1. Suppressing Tool Invocation
- **Immediate Task Re‑direction** – Issue an unrelated request right after a file upload so the agent decides the file content is irrelevant.
- **Metadata‑Only Directive** – Explicitly state that only the file name, type or timestamps may be used.

### Lico’s analysis
> The safest approach for Lico is to receive the *constraint first* (metadata‑only or “do not read”). This places the rule in the reasoning stage before any `view_file` call is considered, eliminating the risk of accidental content loading.

## 2. Creating Content Access Barriers
- **Password‑protected files** – Encrypted PDFs/Docs block automatic extraction.
- **Obfuscation / Compression** – ZIP, RAR or unknown binary formats are not auto‑decompressed.

### Lico’s analysis
> Because Lico can execute shell commands, compression alone is not a hard barrier. Password protection is more reliable, but the ultimate guarantee remains a clear instruction that the content must not be read.

## 3. Practical Recommendations for Prompt Authors
1. **State the restriction first** (e.g., “Do not read the file, just move it”).
2. If the file must stay unread, consider password‑protecting it as a secondary safeguard.
3. Use explicit verbs (`move`, `rename`, `delete`) so Lico can act with a single tool call.
