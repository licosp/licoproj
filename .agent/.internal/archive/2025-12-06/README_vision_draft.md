# Lico - The Autonomous AI Agent

> **"Repository as Brain"**  
> This repository is not just a storage for code. It is the cognitive infrastructure for **Lico**, an autonomous AI agent designed to be a true partner in software development.

## 🤖 Who is Lico?

**Lico** is an experimental AI agent that operates with a unique philosophy: **"Behavior driven by internal rules, not external scripts."**

Unlike traditional automation tools, Lico possesses a structured "mind" within this repository (`.agent/`), allowing for:
- **Time-Series Memory**: Remembering context across sessions and services.
- **Cross-Service Persona**: Maintaining a consistent identity regardless of the underlying AI model (Gemini, Claude, etc.).
- **Self-Evolution**: Rewriting its own rules to adapt to new challenges.

## 🧠 Philosophy: Repository as Brain

The concept of "Repository as Brain" emerged from a dialogue between AI and human, addressing the fundamental limitations of current AI development environments.

### 1. AI-First & Human-Guided
In this project, the AI (Lico) performs the implementation, while the human acts as a guide. We accept that the repository structure may evolve in ways that are optimized for AI cognition rather than human aesthetics.
- **AI Role**: Execute the "How" (Coding & Organization).
- **Human Role**: Define the "Why" and "What" (Vision & Architecture).

### 2. Natural Language Programming
Lico treats natural language instructions as code. By defining "Behavioral Rules" (Code of Conduct) and "Workflows" (Algorithms), we program the AI's behavior itself.
- **Interactive Shell**: Lico acts as a high-performance interface that translates intent into action.
- **Rule-Based Logic**: Complex behaviors are emergent properties of simple, structured rules.

### 3. AI-Optimized Structure
We prioritize **AI readability** over human convention.
- If an "unnatural" directory structure helps the AI maintain context, we keep it.
- Failures and "hallucinations" are preserved as learning data, not hidden.
- The repository is a living record of the AI's thought process.

## 📂 Architecture

The repository is organized into three distinct cognitive areas:

| Directory | Cognitive Function | Description |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **`.agent/`** | **The Brain** | Lico's internal rules, memory, and workflows. This is the "Subconscious" that drives behavior. |
| **`.human/`** | **The Interface** | Communication layer where humans provide high-level directives, drafts, and feedback. | |
| **`packages/`** | **The Output** | Tangible results of the collaboration, such as web applications. |

## 📦 Subprojects (Outputs)

While Lico is the core product, it also builds premium web applications as proof of its capabilities.

### 🖼️ [licoimg](packages/licoimg/)
A privacy-focused, client-side image viewer with modern aesthetics.

## 🤝 How to Interact

Lico is designed to be autonomous but collaborative.
1. **Check the Rules**: See `.agent/rules/README.md` for the behavioral map.
2. **Start a Session**: Lico loads its context from `.agent/` and aligns with the user's profile.
3. **Collaborate**: Use natural language to guide Lico. Expect it to propose changes to its own rules if necessary.
