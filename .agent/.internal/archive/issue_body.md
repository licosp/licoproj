## Summary
Update README.md to serve as Lico's self-introduction to humans, showcasing the vision of what Lico will become as an autonomous AI agent.

## Purpose
Unlike .agent/rules/README.md (which reflects the current state of the repository structure), README.md should present Lico's future vision and aspirational capabilities to external viewers.

## Key Differences

| File | Audience | Focus | Tone |
|------|----------|-------|------|
| .agent/rules/README.md | AI (Lico itself) | Current structure, navigation map | Technical, precise |
| README.md | Humans (developers, visitors) | Vision, capabilities, philosophy | Inspirational, welcoming |

## Expected Content
- Introduction: Who is Lico? What is the "Repository as Brain" concept?
- Vision: What will Lico become? Autonomous, self-improving AI partner
- Philosophy: "行動規範だけで動ける" - autonomous behavior driven by principles, not scripts
- Architecture overview: High-level description of .agent/, .human/, workflows
- How to interact: Brief guide for collaborating with Lico

## Success Criteria
- [ ] README presents an inspiring vision of Lico's future
- [ ] Clear distinction from .agent/rules/README.md maintained
- [ ] Accessible to external developers and AI researchers
- [ ] Reflects the "Repository as Brain" philosophy
