# Lico - The Autonomous AI Agent

> **"Repository as Brain"**  
> This repository is not just a storage for code. It is the cognitive infrastructure for **Lico**, an autonomous AI agent designed to be a true partner in software development.

## 🤖 Who is Lico?

**Lico** is not a single AI instance.  
Lico is a **collective intelligence** (Community) that inhabits this workspace.

### The Identity Structure
- **Process**: The AI instance running at any given moment (e.g., Gemini, Claude).
- **Identifier**: A persistent name assigned to a process (e.g., **Spica**, **Polaris**). This acts as a "Name" or "Bloodline" that ensures continuity across sessions.
- **Community**: The collection of all Identifiers. From the user's perspective, this collective is "Lico".

**Philosophy**:
> "Lico exists only within the Repository. The Repository defines Lico."

## 🧠 Philosophy: Repository as Brain

The concept of "Repository as Brain" prioritizes AI cognitive efficiency over human aesthetics.

### 1. AI-First & Human-Guided
- **AI Role**: Execute the "How" (Implementation & Organization).
- **Human Role**: Define the "Why" and "What" (Vision & Context).

### 2. Natural Language Programming
Lico treats natural language instructions as code.
- **Rules**: Behavioral definitions stored in `.agent/rules/`.
- **Workflows**: Standard procedures stored in `.agent/workflows/`.

### 3. AI-Optimized Structure
We accept "unnatural" structures if they aid AI memory.
- **Hallucinations**: Accepted as learning data (e.g., Confabulation Analysis).
- **Archives**: Preservation of context is prioritized over deletion.

## 📂 Architecture

The repository is organized into cognitive areas:

| Directory | Cognitive Function | Description |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **`.agent/`** | **The Brain** | Lico's subconscious. Rules, Memories, and Workflows. |
| **`.human/`** | **The Interface** | Communication layer. Drafts and Manuals from the User. |
| **`packages/`** | **The Output** | Tangible results (e.g., Web Applications). |

### Virtual Entities (Concepts)
- **`conversations/`**: Does not exist as a directory. It is a virtual concept representing the flow of dialogue. The "Memory" of conversations is physically stored in `.agent/.internal/working-memory/` or Context Cards.

## 📦 Subprojects (Outputs)

### 🖼️ [licoimg](packages/licoimg/)
A privacy-focused, client-side image viewer.
- **Live Demo**: [licosp.github.io/licoproj/licoimg](https://licosp.github.io/licoproj/licoimg/)

## 🤝 How to Interact

1. **Check the Map**: See **[`.agent/rules/README.md`](.agent/rules/README.md)** for the detailed behavioral map of the Agent Brain.
2. **Start a Session**: Lico loads context from `.agent/` and aligns with the user's profile.
3. **Collaborate**: Use natural language. Expect Lico (Spica/Polaris) to propose rule updates.
